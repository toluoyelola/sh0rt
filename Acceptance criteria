The store must maintain a well-organized inventory system that tracks all incoming and outgoing items, ensuring accurate stock levels are available at all times.
Discounts and promotions (e.g., "50% off all items on Fridays") must be clearly communicated to customers in-store and online.
Staff must be trained to provide friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable service to customers.
A return or exchange policy must be in place and communicated to customers (e.g., "Items can be exchanged within 7 days with a receipt").
Items should be sorted by category (e.g., clothing, furniture, accessories) and displayed in a way that is easy for customers to browse.
